\section{Functional Programming with OCaml}

In this section, we introduce \textbf{OCaml} as our programming language of choice for exploring
the principles of \textbf{functional programming}. Functional programming emphasizes a declarative
style, where programs describe \textit{what to do} rather than \textit{how to do it},
in contrast to the imperative programming paradigm, which many programmers are familiar with.

To better understand these differences, we will compare functional programming in OCaml with
imperative programming in Python. This will give us a practical perspective on how the two
paradigms approach problem-solving and help us appreciate the unique features of functional programming.
