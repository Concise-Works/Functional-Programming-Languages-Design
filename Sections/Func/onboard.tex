\section{Development Environment with OCaml}

In this section, we introduce \textbf{OCaml} as our programming language of choice for exploring
the principles of \textbf{functional programming}. Functional programming emphasizes a declarative
style, where programs describe \textit{what to do} rather than \textit{how to do it},
in contrast to the imperative programming paradigm, which many programmers are familiar with.

When we begin programming in OCaml, we will skip all features which are not necessary in a 
functional programming context. Though this text does cover some imperative features for curiosity sake, it is excludes 
many others. For full OCaml documentation visit: \href{https://ocaml.org/docs/values-and-functions}{https://ocaml.org/docs/values-and-functions}.



\newpage

\begin{Def}[OCaml]

	\textbf{OCaml} is a general-purpose programming language from the ML family,
	known for its strong static type system, type inference, and support for functional,
	imperative, and object-oriented programming. It is widely used in areas like compilers,
	financial systems, and formal verification due to its safety, performance,
	and expressive syntax. \underline{ The \textbf{Ocaml Extension} is \snippet{.ml}}
\end{Def}

\noindent
In addition to using Ocaml we will use Dune and Opam.
\begin{Def}[Dune]

	\textbf{Dune} is a build system for \textbf{OCaml} projects, designed to simplify
	the compilation and management of code. It automates tasks such as building executables,
	libraries, and tests, while handling dependencies efficiently. Dune is widely used in the
	OCaml ecosystem due to its ease of use and minimal configuration.

\end{Def}

\begin{Def}[OPAM]

	\textbf{OPAM} (OCaml Package Manager) is the standard package manager for the OCaml programming
	language. It simplifies the installation, management, and sharing of OCaml libraries and tools,
	providing developers with a convenient way to manage dependencies and project environments.
\end{Def}

\noindent
If you are familiar with \textbf{npm} or \textbf{yarn}, \textbf{OPAM} serves a similar purpose but is specifically designed for the \textbf{OCaml} ecosystem. Like npm and yarn, OPAM is a package manager that simplifies the installation and management of libraries and dependencies. Additionally, it offers features tailored to OCaml development, such as managing multiple compiler versions and isolating project environments.



\begin{Note}
	\underline{\textbf{Window Users:}} It may be easier to use WSL or a Linux VM to run OCaml and Dune rather than a native install.
	This text will use \textbf{Ubuntu} distro. If using WSL, make sure the terminal is running the distro, it will give you a fresh
	file system to work with. If you are a Mac user, you may use \textbf{Homebrew} to install OCaml and Dune.

	\noindent
	\textbf{WSL Installation:} \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment}{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment}
\end{Note}

\begin{Tip}
	If you plan to use github as your repository manager, you may have to create a personal access token to connect your account to your local machine.\\

\subsection{Preparing the Environment}
\noindent
Next we enable our machine to compile and run OCaml code. Choose a line below that
corresponds to your operating system, and run it in the terminal.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Installing OPAM on Various Systems}, numbers=left]
    # Homebrew (macOS)
    brew install opam
    
    # MacPort (macOS)
    port install opam
    
    # Ubuntu
    apt install opam
    
    # Debian
    apt-get install opam
    
    # Arch Linux
    pacman -S opam
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
Before we can use OPAM to manage OCaml libraries and tools, we need to prepare the system by running the \snippet{opam init} command. This sets up OPAM by:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Initializing OPAM}]
    # Initialize OPAM
    opam init
    
    # Configure your shell environment
    eval $(opam env)
    
    # Verify OPAM is ready to use
    opam --version
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
After these steps, OPAM will be ready to manage OCaml dependencies, compilers, and project environments.
\begin{Note}
	\underline{\textbf{Important:}} With every new terminal, \snippet{eval \$(opam env)} must be ran for OCaml use.
	Without it, the terminal might not recognize OPAM-installed tools or compilers.
\end{Note}

\subsection{Creating and Using an OPAM Switch}

To manage different versions of OCaml and keep project dependencies isolated, OPAM provides a feature called a \textbf{switch}.
A switch is an environment tied to a specific OCaml compiler version and a unique set of installed packages. This is especially
useful for working on multiple projects with different requirements.

\newpage
\noindent
For this setup, we will create a new switch to ensure a clean environment with the required version of OCaml.
Follow these steps:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Creating and Activating an OPAM Switch}]
    # Step 1: Create a new switch named "my_switch" with OCaml version 5.2.1
    opam switch create my_switch 5.2.1
    
    # Step 2: Activate the newly created switch
    opam switch my_switch
    
    # Step 3: Update your terminal environment to reflect the switch
    eval $(opam env)
    
    # Step 4: Verify the switch is active
    opam switch
    
    # (Or / Optionally) Check the OCaml version
    ocaml -version
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
Once these commands are executed, your terminal will be configured to use the OCaml version and environment
defined by the switch \snippet{my\_switch}.

\subsection{Updating OPAM and Installing Essential Packages}
After initializing OPAM and creating a switch, the next step is to update OPAM's package repository and install
the tools we’ll need for development. These packages provide essential utilities for OCaml programming and project management.
Run the following commands:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Updating OPAM and Installing Packages}]
# Step 1: Update OPAM to fetch the latest package information
opam update

# Step 2: Install essential development tools
opam install dune utop ounit2 menhir ocaml-lsp-server

# Step 3: Install the custom library for this course
opam install stdlib320/.
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
Here's what each package does:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \snippet{dune}: A modern build system for OCaml projects. It automates the compilation and management of OCaml code.
	\item \snippet{utop}: A user-friendly OCaml REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for testing and experimenting with OCaml code interactively.
	\item \snippet{ounit2}: A testing framework for OCaml, similar to JUnit for Java, used for writing and running unit tests.
	\item \snippet{menhir}: A parser generator for OCaml, often used for developing compilers and interpreters.
	\item \snippet{ocaml-lsp-server}: A Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for OCaml, enabling features like autocompletion, type inference, and error checking in editors.
	\item \snippet{stdlib320/}: A custom library created for the CS320 course at Boston University by Nathan Mull. It provides
	      It's a very small subset of the OCaml Standard Library with a bit more documentation. Documentation: \href{https://nmmull.github.io/CS320/landing/Spring-2025/Specifications/Stdlib320/index.html}{https://nmmull.github.io/CS320/...}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
These will be the main tools used throughout this text.

\subsection{Creating a Dune Project: Ocaml Introduction}

To understand how \snippet{dune} structures projects and facilitates OCaml development, we'll create a simple project called \snippet{hello\_dune}.
This hands-on example will demonstrate the purpose of each folder and guide you through building, running, and testing an OCaml project.

\noindent
\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
\subsubsection{Step 1: Prepare Your Environment}

Before starting, ensure OPAM and your environment are set up. Run the following command to prepare the shell:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Preparing Your OPAM Environment}]
    eval $(opam env)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
This ensures that your terminal is configured correctly to work with OCaml and \snippet{dune}.\\
\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

\subsubsection{Step 2: Create the Project}

\noindent
Run the following commands to create a new \snippet{dune} project called \snippet{hello\_dune}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Creating the Project}]
    mkdir demo # Create a new folder named hello_dune for our project
    cd demo    # Move into the project directory
    dune init project hello_dune # Initialize a new dune project
    dune clean                   # Clean project from previous build files
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
This will generate the following project structure inside the \snippet{demo} folder:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Generated Project Structure}]
    hello_dune/
    |-- bin/         # Contains the main executable code
    |-- lib/         # Contains reusable library code
    |-- test/        # Contains test code
    |-- dune-project         # Defines the project
    |-- hello_dune.opam      # OPAM package definition
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
For now, we will focus on the \snippet{bin/} and \snippet{lib/} folders.

\subsubsection{Step 3: Build and Verify the Project}

To ensure everything is set up correctly, use the following command to build the project:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Building the Project}]
    dune build
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
\textbf{This command:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compiles the OCaml source files in your project.
    \item Resolves dependencies and ensures libraries and executables are built in the correct order.
    \item Creates a build cache to speed up future builds.
    \item Verifies that your project is configured correctly.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Important Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You must run \snippet{dune build} every time you make changes to your code to ensure the build reflects your edits.
    \item Running \snippet{dune build} from any subdirectory within redirect to the project root and build.
    \item If there are any issues (e.g., syntax errors, missing files, or incorrect configurations), \snippet{dune} will report them.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}\\
\subsubsection{Step 4: Modify and Run the Program}

\noindent
To modify the program, first open the file \snippet{bin/main.ml} using Vim:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Opening the File in Vim}]
    vim bin/main.ml
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
This opens the \underline{\textbf{main executable file}} in the Vim editor. Once the file is open, press \snippet{i} to switch to \textit{Insert Mode} and replace its contents with the following code:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=OCaml, caption={Hello, Dune Program}]
    let () = print_endline "Hello, Dune!"
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
After editing, press \snippet{Esc} to return to \textit{Normal Mode}, then type \snippet{:wq} to save the changes and exit Vim.
Now, run the program using the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Running the Program}]
    dune exec ./bin/main.exe
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
You should see the output:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
    Hello, Dune!
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Step 5: Add a Library and Explore Its Use}

The \snippet{lib/} folder is reserved for reusable code that can be shared across different parts of a project. 
In object-oriented programming languages like Java, this is analogous to creating static utility classes 
(e.g., a \snippet{Math} class for reusable mathematical functions).\\

\noindent
1. Create a new file in the \snippet{lib/} folder. \underline{\textbf{Important:}} The name of the file must match the project name. 
   If your project is named \snippet{hello\_dune}, the file should be named:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
   vim lib/hello_dune.ml
   \end{lstlisting}

\vspace{.5em}
\noindent
2. Add a reusable function to \snippet{lib/hello\_dune.ml} (\snippet{ $^\wedge$} concats strings, \snippet{+} is strictly for integers):
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=OCaml]
   let greet name = "Hello, " ^ name ^ "!"
   \end{lstlisting}

\vspace{.5em}
\noindent
3. Verify or update the \snippet{lib/dune} file to expose the library. \underline{The \snippet{name} in the \snippet{dune} file}\\
   \underline{should also match the project name:}
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=PlainText]
   (library
    (name hello_dune))
   \end{lstlisting}

   \noindent If this file is already configured with the above content, no changes are needed.\\

\vspace{.5em}
\noindent
4. Interactively use the library in \snippet{utop}. To end a line in OCaml, use \snippet{;;}:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
   dune utop
   \end{lstlisting}

   \noindent Once inside \snippet{utop}, you can interact with the library:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=OCaml, caption={Using the Library in Utop}]
   Hello_dune.greet "Testing123";;
   \end{lstlisting}

   \noindent
   You should see the output: 

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=OCaml]
    - : string = "Hello, Testing123!".
    \end{lstlisting}
   \vspace{.5em}
   \noindent
   \underline{\textbf{Important}}: Despite \snippet{lib/hello\_dune.ml} being lowercase, it's referenced as \snippet{Hello\_dune} in utop (capitalized).
   More on \snippet{utop} will be discussed later. But you may think of it as a calculator where we can access our functions and libraries.\\

\noindent
5. To quit \snippet{utop}, type \snippet{\#quit;;} or press \snippet{Ctrl+d}.
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=OCaml, caption={Quitting utop}]
   #quit;;
   \end{lstlisting}

\newpage
\noindent
6. We may also modify \snippet{bin/main.ml} to use the library:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=OCaml, caption={Using the Library in Main}]
   let () = print_endline (Hello_dune.greet "Library")
   \end{lstlisting}

\noindent
7. Build and run the program:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
   dune build
   dune exec ./bin/main.exe
   \end{lstlisting}

   \noindent The output should now be:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
   Hello, Library!
   \end{lstlisting}


\noindent
\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

\vspace{.5em}
\noindent
\textbf{What Are Dune Files?}\\

\vspace{-.5em}

\noindent
As you explore the project, you'll notice \snippet{dune} files in various folders such as \snippet{bin/} and \snippet{lib/}. These files 
are configuration files used by the \textit{Dune build system} to manage how your project is compiled and linked.

\noindent
\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}\\

\noindent
1. \textbf{Dune File in \snippet{lib/}:}
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=PlainText, caption={Library Dune File}]
   (library
    (name hello_dune))
   \end{lstlisting}

   \noindent This file defines the \snippet{hello\_dune} library. Dune compiles the code in \snippet{lib/hello\_dune.ml} into a reusable 
   module named \snippet{Hello\_dune}, which can be used in other parts of the project.\\

\noindent
2. \textbf{Dune File in \snippet{bin/}:}
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=PlainText, caption={Executable Dune File}]
   (executable
    (public_name hello_dune)
    (name main)
    (libraries hello_dune))
   \end{lstlisting}

   \noindent This file specifies the executable program:
   \begin{itemize}
       \item \snippet{public\_name hello\_dune}: Defines the name of the program, which you can run with \snippet{dune exec hello\_dune}.
       \item \snippet{name main}: Points to \snippet{bin/main.ml}, which serves as the entry point.
       \item \snippet{libraries hello\_dune}: Links the \snippet{hello\_dune} library to the executable.
   \end{itemize}

\noindent

\newpage

\subsubsection{Step 6: Adding Multiple Functions to a Library}

The \snippet{lib/} folder can contain multiple functions to make the library more versatile and reusable. Instead of limiting the library to one function, we can define several functions in the same file and access them individually or collectively.

\noindent
\textbf{Steps to Add and Use Multiple Functions:}\\

\noindent
1. Modify the \snippet{lib/hello\_dune.ml} file:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=OCaml, caption={Adding Multiple Functions}]
   (* Greets a person with their name. *)
   let greet name = "Hello, " ^ name ^ "!"

   (* Adds two integers. *)
   let add x y = x + y

   (* Multiplies two integers. *)
   let multiply x y = x * y

   (* Checks if x is divisible by y. *)
   let is_divisible x y = x mod y = 0
   \end{lstlisting}
\underline{\textbf{Important:}} equality is \snippet{=} and not \snippet{==} in OCaml.\\

\noindent
2. Use the functions interactively in \snippet{utop}:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
   dune utop
   \end{lstlisting}

    \noindent Now we can access the functions:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=OCaml, caption={Accessing Functions in Utop}]
   # Hello_dune.greet "OCaml";;
   - : string = "Hello, OCaml!"

   # Hello_dune.add 3 5;;
   - : int = 8

   # Hello_dune.multiply 4 6;;
   - : int = 24

   # Hello_dune.is_divisible 10 2;;
   - : bool = true
   \end{lstlisting}

   \begin{Note}
   \textbf{Note:} Every time the library is updated, \snippet{dune build} must run to reflect changes, and \snippet{utop} 
   must be restarted to access the updated functions.
   \end{Note}

   \newpage
   \noindent Alternatively, you can use the \snippet{open} command to avoid prefixing with \snippet{Hello\_dune}:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=OCaml, caption={Using the \texttt{open} Command}]
   # open Hello_dune;;
   # greet "Functional Programming";;
   - : string = "Hello, Functional Programming!"

   # add 7 2;;
   - : int = 9
   \end{lstlisting}

\noindent
3. Update \snippet{bin/main.ml} to use the new functions:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=OCaml, caption={Using the Library in Main}]
    let () =
        let greeting = Hello_dune.greet "OCaml" in
        let sum = Hello_dune.add 3 5 in
        let product = Hello_dune.multiply 4 6 in
        let divisible = Hello_dune.is_divisible 10 2 in
        Printf.printf "%s\nSum: %d\nProduct: %d\nDivisible: %b\n"
        greeting sum product divisible
   \end{lstlisting}
\noindent
In a moment we will discuss \snippet{in}, for brevity you may think, ``let \snippet{variable}, which is this \snippet{expression}, be substituted \snippet{in} this other \snippet{expression} respectively.'' Let us continue. \\

\noindent
4. Build and run the program:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
   dune build
   dune exec ./bin/main.exe
   \end{lstlisting}

   \noindent You should see the output:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
   Hello, OCaml!
   Sum: 8
   Product: 24
   Divisible: true
   \end{lstlisting}

   \vspace{1em}
\noindent
\underline{\textbf{Take Note of The Above:}}\\
\indent
There are no semi-colons at the end of the lines. Though possible, that would make the code imperative, not functional.
Again in functional programming, our code is one large expression. We add lets only to shorthand expressions, then carry
them down the chain of expressions with \snippet{in}. We could have written the our entire expression in the print statement,
but it would be harder to read and write. Hence, there is no idea of state, really emphasizing that, 

\vspace{1em}
\begin{center}
    \LARGE
\textit{``Code is one large equation, not a series of steps.''}
\end{center}

\newpage 
\noindent
\noindent
5. Test the new functions by updating \snippet{test/test\_hello\_dune.ml}:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=OCaml, caption={Adding Tests for Multiple Functions}]
    let () =
        (* Test the greet function *)
        assert (Hello_dune.greet "OCaml" = "Hello, OCaml!");
    
        (* Test the add function *)
        assert (Hello_dune.add 3 5 = 8);
    
        (* Test the multiply function *)
        assert (Hello_dune.multiply 4 6 = 24);
    
        (* Test the is_divisible function *)
        assert (Hello_dune.is_divisible 10 2 = true);
        assert (Hello_dune.is_divisible 5 3 = false)
   \end{lstlisting}

% not sure about this VVVVV

% Though we use semi-colons to separate expressions, this still is functional. Each \snippet{assert}
% is a pure function. Here there is no mutating state or description of control flow.

6. Verify or update the \snippet{test/dune} file to include the library:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=PlainText, caption={Test Dune File}]
   (test
    (name test_hello_dune)
    (libraries hello_dune))
   \end{lstlisting}

\noindent
7. Run the tests:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
   dune runtest
   \end{lstlisting}

   \noindent If all tests pass, there will be no errors. Otherwise, you will see detailed messages
   pointing to any failures. \textbf{Try} to make an error to see if your tests are working.\\

\textbf{Onboarding Conclusion:}\\

\vspace{-.5em}
\noindent
This concludes the onboarding process for OCaml and Dune. We have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Installed OCaml, Dune, and other essential tools.
    \item Created a new Dune project and explored its structure.
    \item Built, modified, and executed an OCaml program.
    \item Added a library and multiple functions with tests.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In the next section, we dive deeper into OCaml's syntax, features, and functional programming concepts.
